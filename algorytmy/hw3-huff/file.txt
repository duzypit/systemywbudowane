Would be correct if your function was correct. Unfortunately you are returning a pointer to a local variable in the function which means that it is a pointer to undefined data as soon as the function returns. You need to use heap allocation like malloc for the string in your function in order for the pointer you return to have any meaning. Then you need to remember to free it later.
